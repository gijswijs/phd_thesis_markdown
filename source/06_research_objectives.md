# Research Objectives

This research aims to study whether Lightning Network offers off-path value privacy and on-path relationship anonymity.

To do so we have the following objectives:

- Reproduce and improve the balance discovery attack as proposed by Herrera-Joancomarti [-@Herrera-Joancomarti2019]
- Analyze passive and active payment correlation attacks by means of network analysis [Piatkivskyi2018]
- Evaluate possible mitigations against payment correlation and balance discovery
- Measure the privacy loss of those attacks on Bitcoin mainnet in terms of $\varepsilon$-differential privacy [@Dwork2006] and taint resistance [@Meiklejohn2015] before and after implementing the mitigations.
