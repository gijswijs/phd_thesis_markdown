# Research Objectives

This research aims to study whether Lightning Network offers off-path value privacy and on-path relationship anonymity.

To do so we have the following objectives:

- Reproduce and improve the balance discovery attack
- Develop passive and active payment correlation attacks
- Develop improvements to the Lightning protocol to mitigate those attacks
- Measure the privacy loss of those attacks on Bitcoin mainnet before and after implementing the improvements.
