# Hypotheses

1. The number of Unilaterally closed payment channels broadcasted to the Bitcoin blockchain in a specific period of time is a predictor for the number of Txs in the PCN.
    a) There is an effect modification of the average transaction fee calculated over the same period
    b) There is an effect modification of the average exchange rate against the US Dollar calculated over the same period
    c) There is an effect modification of the topological average connectedness of the PCN calculated over the same period
2. The fact that contracts belonging to the same Txs in a PCN encode the same condition, is a valid and practical heuristic for significantly reducing anonymity, measured as taint resistance of the coins involved in the Txs.
    a) A passive adversary cannot obtain the information needed to implement this heuristic.
    b) An active adversary can obtain the information needed to implement this heuristic.
3. Anonymity of yet-unidentified entities, measured as taint resistance of the coins involved, in a PCN can accurately be reduced by Supervised Machine Learning algorithms using training set data with linked senders and receivers.
