# Hypotheses

Lightning Network doesn't meet the requirements for value privacy and relationship anonymity. The Lightning messages sent over the Lightning Network leak off-path information about payments (value privacy) and on-path information about the sender and receiver of a transaction (relationship anonymity) to malicious participants, resulting in privacy loss as measured by $\varepsilon$-differential privacy and taint resistance.

The Lightning Network protocol can be improved in such a way that the attacks of said malicious participants have a reduced effect in terms of privacy loss, as measured by $\varepsilon$-differential privacy and taint resistance.
