Interactions between Lightning Network clients on the level of the BOLT protocol and on the level of the P2P network affect the value privacy and relationship anonymity as described by Malavolta [@Malavolta2017].

Interactions between Lightning Network clients on the level of the BOLT protocol and on the level of the P2P network uncover information about payments (value privacy) and information about the sender and receiver of a transaction (relationship anonymity) to malicious participants.

As a null-hypothesis
Interactions between Lightning Network clients on the level of the BOLT protocol and on the level of the P2P network does not uncover information about payments (value privacy) and information about the sender and receiver of a transaction (relationship anonymity) to malicious participants.

Without mentioning protocol level or P2P network level:
The Lightning Network doesn't leak information about payments (value privacy) and information about the sender and receiver of a transaction (relationship anonymity) to malicious participants.

[@Peisert2007]
The Lightning messages sent over the Lightning Network do not leak off-path information about payments (value privacy) or on-path information about the sender and receiver of a transaction (relationship anonymity) to malicious participants.

Two variables: The data set of Lightning messages sent over the network, The Lightning client configuration. The data set is the independent variable (this is what we change), The Lightning client configuration is the dependent variable. (The one we test)
