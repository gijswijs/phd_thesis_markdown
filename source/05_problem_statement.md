# Problem statement

The level of anonymity to be attained in Bitcoin transactions is well studied, but the amount of anonymity to be attained in Lightning Network (LN) running on top of Bitcoin, has yet to be determined through formal privacy analysis.
This study quantifies the achievable anonymity of participants in LN under attack of both passive and active adversaries.
It does so by using a formal threat model and using $\varepsilon$-differential privacy as a quantity for measuring privacy loss.
With LN being touted as *the* solution for Bitcoin's scalability problem, a proper assessment of the anonymity risks of LN is of great importance.
