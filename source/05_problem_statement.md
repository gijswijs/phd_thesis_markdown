# Problem statement

The level of anonymity to be attained in Bitcoin transactions is well studied, but the amount of anonymity to be attained in Payment Channel Networks running on top of Bitcoin, has yet to be determined through formal privacy analysis.
This study quantifies the achievable anonymity of participants in Payment Channel Networks under attack of both passive and active adversaries.
It does so by using a formal threat model and using taint resistance as the quantity to measure anonymity.
With PCN's being touted as *the* solution for Bitcoin's scalability problem, a proper assessment of the anonymity risks of those PCNs is of great importance.
