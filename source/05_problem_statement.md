# Problem statement

The level of anonymity to be attained in Bitcoin transactions is well studied [@spagnuolo2014bitiodine, @koshy2014analysis, @barber2012bitter, @androulaki2013evaluating, @Meiklejohn2015, @Meiklejohn2013, @Reid2013], but the amount of anonymity to be attained in Lightning Network (LN) running on top of Bitcoin, has yet to be determined through formal privacy analysis [@Malavolta2017].
This study quantifies the achievable anonymity of participants in LN under attack of both passive and active adversaries.
It does so by using a formal threat model [@Malavolta2017] and using $\varepsilon$-differential privacy [@Dwork2006] and taint resistance [@Meiklejohn2015] as a quantities for measuring privacy loss.
With LN being touted as *the* solution for Bitcoin's scalability problem, a proper assessment of the anonymity risks of LN is of great importance.
