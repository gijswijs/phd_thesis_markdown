# Introduction

Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization. In the beginning of 2018 Bitcoin hit its highest market cap of 835 billion US Dollar. Although this number has dwindled since then, it's still by far the most popular cryptocurrency. With this popularity some of its flaws have also risen to the surface, scalability being one of them. Several solutions have been proposed to solve these scalability issues, but only one of them has been implemented so far: the Lightning Network (LN). This network runs on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and has the theoretical property of increasing the throughput of transactions dramatically. These solutions have the added benefit of increasing the level of anonymity of the participants. Until now the privacy of the participants in LN have not been formally analyzed. This study seeks to analyze and measure the privacy that can be obtained by participants in the Lightning Network while being exposed to known and yet to be developed attacks on privacy.
