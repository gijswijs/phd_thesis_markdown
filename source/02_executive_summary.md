# Executive summary

The success of Bitcoin, the world's first distributed cryptocurrency, has shed light on its shortcomings. One of these shortcomings is the low throughput of 3 to 7 transactions per second. To make Bitcoin a feasible candidate for a global payment network, these numbers have to increase dramatically.

To achieve this, solutions have been proposed that run on top of Bitcoin, in a sort of second layer. The majority of transactions now occurring in the Bitcoin blockchain could theoretically be offloaded into this second layer, thereby improving the throughput to levels that rival current centralized global payment networks like VISA. The Lightning Network (LN) has emerged as the first real contender of being such a network.

These networks have the additional property of improving the anonymity and privacy of the participants. Privacy and anonymity on the level of the native Bitcoin blockchain, the first layer, so to speak, is a well-studied subject. But this body of knowledge is still lacking when it comes to the payment channels networks (PCN's) like LN proposed for the second layer.

The aim of this study is to formally analyze privacy in the context of LN.

The results should provide a formal analysis of privacy in LN. It seeks to increase the awareness of the risks involved in dealing with cryptocurrencies, and proposes improvements to the LN protocol that safeguard the privacy of the participants. Lastly, the techniques developed in this research should be beneficial in due-diligence of reporting institutions by scrutinizing and screening blockchain and LN transactions.
